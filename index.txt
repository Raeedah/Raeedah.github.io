        <h2>A bit about me, Raeedah Choudhury</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in Katy, Texas, I moved to Atlanta, Georgia after finishing high school to attend the Georgia Institute of Technology. I majored in Biomedical Engineering while minoring in Computer Science, focusing on Systems and Architecture. At the start of my second year, I became a Teaching Assistant for CS1371, Computing for Engineers, a class focusing on building a foundation in MATLAB for data analysis and other processes. In the fall of 2018 I will join Epic Systems to improve their software for clients and their patients.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>Epic Systems</h3>
        <p>Coming soon in Fall 2018!</p>
        <h3>Georgia Institute of Technology</h3>
        <p>As a Teaching Assistant (TA) for CS1371, I taught a subsection of the class weekly, held office hours to assist students with homework, and led a group of TAs in writing test questions and editing the tests holistically. Being in this role for five semesters (August 2016 - May 2018), I gained skills in team management, working with coworkers and students of different backgrounds and skill in different contexts, and professionalism.</p>
        <h3>McDonald's</h3>
        <p>During the summer of 2016, I worked almost 40 hours a week as a crew member at McDonald's, taking and preparing orders, making drinks, and manning the fryers.</p>
        <h3>Kroger</h3>
        <p>While working at McDonald's, I also put in 12 hours a week at Kroger as a cashier.</p>
        <h3>Best In Class Education</h3>
        <p>From January 2015 - March 2015, I tutored math afterschool and on Saturdays for groups of kids K-12.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2> <!--TODO: Add images/poster/slides/papers for each-->
        <h3>Pediatric Intubation - SABR Quickscope</h3>
        <p>In the Spring of 2018, I worked on a team of four to address dificulties in inserting intubation tubes in pediatric patients, especially in emergency situations. To understand the problem, we interviewed 12 physicians, nurses, and students with varying experience in intubation. Our solution, the SABR Quickscope, integrates a combined laryngoscope and guiding channel, decreasing the number of peices of equipment and freeing one hand of the user. The feature unique to the SABR is an angulation peice, that allows the user to bend the tip of the breathing tube at an angle appropriate for the patient, making it easier to navigate the trachea and glottic opening. We presented our working protoype to various physicians, students, and families at the Georgia Tech Spring Capstone Expo in April 2018.</p> <!--TODO: hovering over anatomical terms should show diagram/explanation-->
        <h3>Peripheral Vein Catheters Redesign - Near-Infared Vein Locator</h3>
        <p>In the Fall of 2017, I worked on a team of four to adress difficulties in inserting peripheral vein catheters (PVCs) in elderly, dehydrated, and other patients in high-stress environments. Our solution was to develop a guiding system that attached to the patient to provide stability and near-infared lights to help visualize the location of the patient's veins.</p>
        <h3>Concussion Prevention - TMS Cap</h3>
        <p>In the Spring of 2016, I worked on a team of eight to address the lack of concussion diagnostic and treatment tools, especially for athletes. Our approach was to mitigate damage during a concussive hit and apply treatment that would prevent serious long-term effects. This was done by integrating transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a cap that would fit under a aathlete's helmet. TMS is currently used to activate neurons to counter the effects of damaged neurons, such as Alzheimer's or other mental disorders. By applying TMS during and immediatley after a concussive hit, decreased neuron damage can potentially decrease or prevent the onset of these mental disordes. We presented models and research supporting our work at the Tech4Good Showcase in December 2016.</p>
